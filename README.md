# React Live Validator Form

A clean, responsive registration form component that demonstrates **real-time validation** using React's derived state pattern.

## Features

* **Live Feedback:** Validation runs instantly as the user types.
* **Smart Error Handling:** Error messages only appear after the user interacts with a field (no errors on initial load).
* **Derived State:** Validation logic is calculated on the fly during render, avoiding redundant state variables or `useEffect`.
* **Visual Cues:** Inputs turn red and display helper text when invalid.
* **Safe Submission:** The "Sign Up" button remains disabled until the entire form is valid.

## Validation Rules

* **Email:** Must contain special characters (`@` and `.`).
* **Password:** Must be at least 9 characters long.
* **Confirm Password:** Must match the password exactly.

## Tech Stack

* React (Functional Components & Hooks)
* CSS (Responsive layout & interactive states)
